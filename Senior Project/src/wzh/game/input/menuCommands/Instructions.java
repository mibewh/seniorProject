	  This game is about capturing your enemy's Main Castle that is located somewhere on the map while defending against the same thing from
	  happening to you.
	  In order to capture structures, you must move your units, shown to you in your respective colors, onto the square with the structure on it.
	  There is currently three structures you can capture and four you can occupy. They are:
	  the Main Castle - the objective you are trying to capture and defend at the same time.
	  the Castle - the structure you can use to muster your troops.
	  the Village - your main source of income to fund your growing army.
	  the Fort - a simple defenseive structure that gives you a defensive bonus whenever you occupy it. Otherwise, it has no other value.
	  
	  There are different types of terrain in this game, however, they can be generally put into three distinct categories:
	  Passable - Passable terrain allows your units to move unhindered for their maximum movement. However the empty terrain is wide open, so
	  watch out!!!
	  Difficult - Difficult terrain takes two movement points to move across, however, they are rough and lets your units to take cover whenever
	  an enemy attacks. It is good to try to end your unit's turn on difficult terrain.
	  Obstructions - They serve no purpose other than to infuriate you and cause you to be unable to pass through them. However they do look very
	  pretty.
	  
	  As of right now, there is four diffent types of units your army can field. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages:
	  the Spearman - this worthless unit are cheap to field and are good against horses. Otherwise they suck. Even against themselves. Use they
	  early on when you don't have as gold in order to quickly flood the fields.
	  the Swordsman -  this manly unit is hardy and serves its purpose as a hearty frontline troop.
